%
%                This function defines a particular sound to play for
%                a particular trigger number.
%         
%                The soundVector is either a 1xNUM_SAMPLES (mono)
%                or 2xNUM_SAMPLES (stereo) in the range [-1,1].
%
%                side is either 'left', 'right' or 'both', and
%                controls which speaker side the sound will play from.
%
%                tau_ms is the number of milliseconds to do a cosine2
%                stop-ramp function when triggering the sound to 'stop'.
%                Default is 0, meaning don't ramp-down the volume.
%                If nonzero, the volume will be ramped-down for a 'gradual
%                stop' over time tau_ms on trigger-stop events.
%                NB: On natural, untriggered stops, no ramping is
%                ever applied, since it is assumed that the
%                soundfile itself ramps whatever it contains down
%                to 0 volume naturally.
%
%                predelay_s is the amount of time in seconds to pre-delay the
%                playing of the sound when triggering.  This
%                functionally prepends predelay_s seconds worth of
%                zeroes to the sound matrix so as to cause sounds
%                to play with a predefined delay from the time they
%                are triggered to the time that real sounds
%                actually begin emanating from the speakers.
%                (As strange as this may seem, delaying sound
%                output from the time of the trigger to when the
%                sound really plays is useful to some protocols).
%
%                If loop_flg is true, the sound should loop indefinitely
%                whenever it is triggered, otherwise it will play
%                only once for each triggering.
%
%                Calling this function with a stereo soundVector and
%                any side parameter other than 'both' is supported
%                and is a good way to suppress the output of one side.
%
%                Sampling rate note: Each file that is loaded to the 
%                RTLSoundMachine takes the sampling rate currently 
%                set via the SetSampleRate() method.  In other words, it is 
%                necessary to call SetSampleRate() before calling LoadSound() 
%                for each file you load via LoadSound() if all your sound 
%                files' sampling rates differ!  Likewise, you need to reload
%                sound files if you want new sampling rates set via
%                SetSamplingRate() to take effect.
