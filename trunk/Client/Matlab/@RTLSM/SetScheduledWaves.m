%                 There are two usages of this function, with somewhat

%                 scheduled wave.  See descriptions below.  
%
%                 Note: it is now necessary to call

% DIGITAL I/O LINE SCHEDULED WAVE
% -------------------------------
%
% sm = SetScheduledWaves(sm, sched_matrix)
%
%                Specifies the scheduled waves matrix for a state machine.  
%                This is an M by 7 matrix of the following format
%                per row:
%                ID IN_EVENT_COL OUT_EVENT_COL DIO_LINE PREAMBLE SUSTAIN REFRACTION
%                Note that this function doesn't actually modify the 
%                SchedWaves of the FSM immediately.  Instead, a new 
%                SetStateMatrix call needs to be issued for the effects of 
%                this function to take effect in the external RTLinux FSM.

% Detailed Explanation of DIO Line Scheduled Wave
% -----------------------------------------------
%
% The sched matrix is an M by 7 matrix of the following format:
%
% ID IN_EVENT_COL OUT_EVENT_COL DIO_LINE PREAMBLE SUSTAIN REFRACTION
%
% Note that this function doesn't acrually modify the SchedWaves of the 
% FSM.  Instead, a new SetStateMatrix call needs to be issued 
% for the effects of this function to actually take effect in the external
% RTLinux FSM.
%
% As for the matrix this function expected, column has the following 
% definition:
% ID -
%      the numeric id of the scheduled wave.  Each wave is numbered from
%      0-31.  (NOTE: 0 is a valid ID!). The ID is later used in the 
%      StateMatrix SCHED_WAVE column as a bitposition.  So for example if 
%      you want wave number with ID 10 to fire, you use 2^10 in the 
%      SCHED_WAVE column of the state matrix and 10 as the ID in this 
%      matrix.  You can *untrigger* scheduled waves by issuing a
%      negative number.  To untrigger wave ID 10, you would issue
%      -(2^10) in your state matrix.
% IN_EVENT_COL -
%      The column of the state matrix (0 being the first column) which
%      is to be used as the INPUT event column when this wave goes HIGH
%      (edge up). Think of this as a WAVE-IN event. Set this value to -1 to
%      have the state machine not trigger a state matrix input event for
%      edge-up transitions.
% OUT_EVENT_COL -
%      The column of the state matrix (0 being the first column) which
%      is to be used as the INPUT event column when this wave goes LOW
%      (edge down).  Think of this as a WAVE-OUT event.
%      Set this value to -1 to have the state machine not trigger a state 
%      matrix input event for edge-down transitions.
% DIO_LINE -
%      The DIO line on which to echo the output of this waveform.  Note
%      that not all waves need have a real DIO line associated with them.
%      Set this value to -1 to not use a DIO line.
% PREAMBLE (seconds) -
%      The amount of time to wait (in seconds) from the time the scheduled
%      wave is triggered in the state matrix SCHED_WAVE column to the time
%      it actually goes high.  Fractional numbers are ok.  Note the
%      granularity of this time specification is the time quantum
%      of the state machine (typically 166 microsecs), so values smaller
%      than this quantum are probably going to get rounded to the
%      nearest quantum.
% SUSTAIN (seconds) -
%      The amount of time to wait (in seconds) from the time the
%      scheduled wave is goes high to the time it should go low again.
%      Stated another way, the amount of time a scheduled wave
%      sustains a high state.  Fractional numbers are ok.  Note the
%      granularity of this time specification is the time quantum of
%      the state machine (typically 166 microsecs), so values smaller than
%      this quantum are probably going to get rounded to the nearest
%      quantum
% REFRACTION (seconds) - 
%      The amount of time to wait (in seconds) from the time the
%      scheduled wave is goes low to the time it can successfully be
%      triggered again by the SCHED_WAVE column of the state
%      matrix. Fractional numbers are ok.  Note the granularity of
%      this time specification is the time quantum of the state
%      machine (typically 166 microsecs), so values smaller than this quantum
%      are probably going to get rounded to the nearest quantum.

% ANALOG I/O LINE SCHEDULED WAVE ------------------------------
%
% sm = SetScheduledWaves(sm, sched_wave_id, ao_line, loop_bool, two_by_n_matrix)
%                Specifies a scheduled wave using analog I/O for a state 
%                machine.  The sched_wave_id is in the same id-space as the
%                digital scheduled waves described above. The ao_line is
%                the analog output channel to use, starting at 1 for the
%                first AO line.  loop_bool, if true, means this is a
%                looping wave (it loops until untriggered).The last
%                parameter, a 2-by-n matrix, is described below.
%
% Detailed Explanation of AO Line Scheduled Wave
% ----------------------------------------------
% Like a digital scheduled wave described above, an analog scheduled wave
% is triggered from the SCHED_WAVES column of the state matrix using a
% 2^sched_wave_id bit position.  Triggering it actually causes samples to
% be written to the ao_line output channel on the DAQ card (AO lines are
% indexed from 1). The samples to be written (along with the events in the
% FSM to trigger) are specified in a two-by-n matrix as the fourth
% parameter to this function.   As the output wave is played, events to the
% state machine can be generated to update/notify the state machine of
% progress during playback (see description of the two-by-n matrix below). 
%
% Note that this function doesn't actually modify the SchedWaves of the FSM
% immediately. Instead, a new SetStateMatrix call needs to be issued for
% the effects of this function to take effect in the external RTLinux FSM.
%
% Two-by-n-matrix description
% ---------------------------
% The actual samples to be written to the ao_line are specified in a
% two-by-n matrix.  
%
% The first row of this matrix is a row-vector of samples over the range
% [-1,1].  They get automatically scaled to the output range setting of the
% DAQ hardware (0-5V for instance, etc).  The rate at which these samples
% get written is usually 6kHz, but it depends on the rate at which the FSM
% is running, and it cannot be changed from Matlab (it is a parameter to
% the realtime kernel module implementing the actual FSM).
%
% The second row of the matrix may be all zeroes.  If any position in the
% matrix is not zero, then it indicates an input event number in the state
% machine (indexed at 1) to trigger when the corresponding sample (in the
% first row) is played. The purpose of this feature is to allow the state
% machine to be notified when 'interesting' parts of the scheduled analog
% wave are being played, so that the state machine may do something with
% that information such as: change its state, jump to a sub-block of 
% states, etc.
%
% Example:
%
% SetScheduledWaves(sm, 0, 1, 0, [ -1 -.999 -.988 0.25 0.26; ...
%                                   0     0     0   1    0   ]);
%
% Would specify a scheduled wave with id 0, on analog line 1 (the first
% line), non-looping.  When wave id 0 is triggered, the state machine is to
% play the five samples in row 1 of the above matrix (normally your output
% matrix will contain more than 5 samples -- this is not very useful since
% it's only 5 samples at 6kHz but it is an example after all).  For all but
% the fourth sample, no event in the state machine is triggered. However,
% as soon as the fourth sample is played by the state machine, input event
% column 1 (the first column) of the state matrix is sent an event (which
% might cause a state transition, depending on the state matrix).  
%
% BUGS & QUIRKS
% -------------
%
% Untriggering analog or digital scheduled waves requires you to
% issue a *negative* bitpattern.  So to untrigger waves 1,2,3 and 5
% you would need to issue -(2^1+2^2+2^3+2^5) in your state matrix
% scheduled waves output column.
%
% The DIO SetScheduledWaves indexes I/O lines at 0 and state event columns
% at 0 while its analog counterpart indexes I/O lines at 1 and the same
% state event columns at 1.  This is inconsitent. Let me know which one
% should win -- ie if you want consistency tell me if you prefer indexing
% at 1 or at 0.  
%
% The DIO SetScheduledWaves specifies *all* DIO sched waves at once as one
% call, whereas the AO SetScheduledWaves specifies one AO wave per call
% (thus requiring multiple calls for multiple AO waves).
%
% If these functions are called and an AO wave has the same id as a
% pre-existing DIO wave (or vice-versa), the existing wave is discarded and a
% warning is issued.
