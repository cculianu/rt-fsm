How to use the FSMEmulator on Windows:  
--------------------------------------

  1. Make sure all the files in the win32/ distribution directory are together 
     in the same folder (the exe's plus a bunch of .dll's plus the tcc 
     directory).

  2. Double-click on FSMEmulator.exe to run!

  That's it!

  (Coming soon -- an installer for Windows!)




How to use the FSMEmulator on Mac OSX:
--------------------------------------

  Nota Bene:

  At this time, only Intel binaries are provided.  This is because I lack 
  access to a PPC Mac and I haven't really had time/inclination to look into
  cross-compiling for PPC.  So -- you are forced to use an Intel Mac!

  To run:

  1. Double-click on the FSMEmulator.app application bundle, and it should
     just launch seamlessly.

  That's it!
