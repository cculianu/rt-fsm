    Note that since the L22 is 'always playing' calling this function
    is equivalent to calling L22Play(), except here you have the 
    opportunity to change the soundbuffer being played.

    Calling this function with a NULL buffer pointer will stop playing
    sounds (play silence) and is equivalent to calling L22Stop().

    the sound data to play.   Note: The bumber of bytes in buffer should be:
    num_samples * NUM_CHANS * (BITS_PER_SAMPLE/8) where NUM_CHANS is 1 for 
    mono, 2 for stereo and BITS_PER_SAMPLE pertains to the various PCM formats 
    above..

    @param format_code   OR of PCMxx define and one of MONO or STEREO defines

    @param chan_id       The mixer channel id to put this sound buffer on. Valid channel id's are from 0-7 (meaning up to 8 simultaneous sounds can play).  Use this same chan_id when calling L22Play() at a later time.

    @param looped if true, loop the sound infinitely (by wrapping around to beginning) after it is played.  The sound can only be stopped with an L22Stop()

    @returns true on success, false if there is some error (most likely due
    to sampling rate/format invalid)  */
