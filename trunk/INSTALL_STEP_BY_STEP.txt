These are May 19, 2010, notes by Sundeep Tuteja, ex-Computer Analyst in the Brody lab, on how to install the code on a brand-new RTLinux machine. Your local setup may require some adjustments-- these instructions have been used, and are known to work, for SuperLogics machines Model SL-3U-CL-IQ965-GA.  

These instructions use Calin's automated install.sh script that comes with the distribution-- the instructions are intended for novice users, and will only work on machines on which Fedora 9 can be installed and on which the automated script works.


----------------



1. Make sure that you have access to the Ethernet. (For example, in the Brody lab at HHMI at Princeton University, this involves obtaining the MAC addresses of the ethernet cards inside the machine and sending them to the Molbio IT Staff along with a request to have them registered. Include the fact that as many IP addresses are needed as there are ethernet cards.)

2. Install N Lynx L22 soundcards and one National Instruments DAQ card in the RTLinux machine. N should be the number of rigs you want to run from this Linux machine. Up to N=3 has been tested and works.

3. Turn on the system and insert a DVD of Fedora 9 (complete install) (32 bit). Boot from the disk.

4. You should be shown a screen saying 'Welcome to Fedora 9!'. Select 'Install or upgrade an existing system' and press ENTER.
